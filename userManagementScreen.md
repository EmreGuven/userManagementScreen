# User Management Screen

## Requirements
The User Management screen is a web-based interface that allows administrators to manage user accounts. The requirements for the User Management screen are as follows:

1. Display a list of existing users with their relevant details.
2. Allow administrators to add new users.
3. Allow administrators to edit the details of existing users.
4. Allow administrators to delete users.
5. Provide search and filter functionality to easily find users based on specific criteria.
6. Implement pagination to display a limited number of users per page.
7. Provide feedback and error messages for user actions and input validation.

## UI Components

### User List
- Display a table/grid layout to present the list of users.
- Show relevant user details such as username, email, role, and last login date.
- Include sorting functionality to sort the user list by various attributes (e.g., username, role, last login).
- Implement pagination to limit the number of users displayed per page.

### Add User Form
- Present a form with input fields to capture user details.
- Include fields such as username, email, password, and role.
- Perform validation on required fields and email format.
- Display error messages for invalid inputs.
- Provide a button to submit the form and create a new user.

### Edit User Form
- Similar to the Add User Form, but pre-fill the form fields with existing user details.
- Allow administrators to modify the user's information.
- Validate the form inputs and display error messages as necessary.
- Provide a button to save the changes made to the user's details.

### Delete User Confirmation
- Display a confirmation dialog box when administrators attempt to delete a user.
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding with the deletion.
- Provide options to confirm or cancel the deletion action.

### Search and Filter
- Include a search bar to allow administrators to search for specific users based on keywords (e.g., username, email).
- Implement filtering options to narrow down the user list based on specific criteria (e.g., role, last login date).

## Initial Page State and Behavior
- Upon loading the User Management screen, retrieve the list of users from the backend API.
- Display the User List component, showing the initial set of users (e.g., the first page with a predefined number of users per page).
- Include navigation controls for pagination (e.g., previous page, next page).
- Show a "Add User" button to open the Add User Form when clicked.
- Allow administrators to click on a user in the User List to open the Edit User Form with the user's details pre-filled.

## Error Handling
- Provide error handling for failed API requests (e.g., network errors, server errors).
- Display appropriate error messages to the user in case of validation failures or other errors.
- Ensure a smooth user experience by handling errors gracefully and providing clear instructions on how to resolve them.
